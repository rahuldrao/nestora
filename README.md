# Nestora

Lightweight, self-hosted cost dashboard for Kubernetes and AWS.

## What is Nestora?

Nestora gives you simple daily reports and visualizations about:
- AWS Service spend (EC2, RDS, EKS, etc)

No complex SaaS integrations. No vendor lock-in. Just fast, clear cost visibility.

- `/frontend/`: Web UI (React or plain HTML/CSS)
- `/k8s-monitor/`: K8s resource monitoring scripts (Prometheus queries)
- `/terraform/`: AWS setup scripts (optional)

## Status
